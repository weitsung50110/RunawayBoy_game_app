# RunawayBoy_game_app
This is a game I created in Unity which I used C# to produce this game app.

In this game, you have to beat the monsters with your baseball bat which can shoot a magic ball to defeat all the monsters.

When you defeat all the monsters that you will see a coin on the road, and if you eat it, then you can pass the level.

## Big christimas pig
Big Christmas pig is a boss that can bite your ass, so you need to handle it carefully.

There are two giant bells here, and they will drop down at any minute, so you need to dodge the attack from the giant ball.
