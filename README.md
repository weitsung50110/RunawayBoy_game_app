# RunawayBoy_game_app
This is a game I created in Unity which I used C# to produce this game app.

In this game, you have to beat the monsters with your baseball bat which can shoot a magic ball to defeat all the monsters.

When you defeat all the monsters that you will see a coin on the road, and if you eat it, then you can pass the level.
